                        The University of Toronto Seismic Design Team (UTSD) is comprised of both engineering and architectural undergraduates who collaborate on designing, building, and analyzing a scaled balsa wood model of a high rise structure.
                        <br/><br/>
                        In the annual EERI Undergraduate Seismic Design Competition (SDC), the team will be judged on the structural modelâ€™s seismic performance, delivery of an oral presentation, poster design, architectural design and general workmanship.
                        Collectively, all of these criteria are captured in a final score called the Final Annual Building Income (FABI) which is used to determine the winner.
                        <br/><br/>
                        By designing a robust yet cost effective structure, UTSD team members are given an excellent hands-on opportunity to learn the basic principles of structural and seismic engineering in an out of classroom environment.
