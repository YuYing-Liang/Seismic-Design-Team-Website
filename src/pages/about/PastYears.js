                    This year our team achieved a number of significant milestones in terms of construction and design based on our experience from the previous year.
                    Firstly, we were able to completely restructure our construction process by employing the use of a full height jig in order to maximize consistency throughout the structure."

                            <p> With this faster and more efficient construction process, our team was able to construct a full scaled prototype to test at the University of Toronto.
                                Special thanks goes out to Professor Christopoulos and Professor Kwon for graciously allowing the team to use the shaketable and to Dr. Reza Hessabi for teaching our team on how to operate the shaketable.

                                The results from these shaketable tests were essential for calibrating our analysis model as well as for deriving the fundamental modal properties of our design.
                                Once our analysis model had been properly calibrated, we were able to optimize the design of the structure through seeking the most cost-effective cross-sectional width of our tubular design that can still allow for architectural flexibility.
