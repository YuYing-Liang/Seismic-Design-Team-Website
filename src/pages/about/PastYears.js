            In our inaugural year competing in the EERI Seismic Design Competition, we learned a great deal about constructing and designing a balsa wood structure to withstand ground motions of varying intensities.
            Our design this year consisted of an integrated structural and architectural systems in order to blend into the architectural scene of San Francisco."

                    <p> A total of seven undergraduate engineering students travelled to San Francisco, CA to compete in the 12th Annual EERI Seismic Design Competition alongside top engineering schools from all over the world.
                        A huge thank you goes out to UBC alumni as well as the graduate students from the University of Toronto for giving us a head start in understanding the competition and structural design!

            This year our team achieved a number of significant milestones in terms of construction and design based on our experience from the previous year.
            Firstly, we were able to completely restructure our construction process by employing the use of a full height jig in order to maximize consistency throughout the structure."

                    <p> With this faster and more efficient construction process, our team was able to construct a full scaled prototype to test at the University of Toronto.
                        Special thanks goes out to Professor Christopoulos and Professor Kwon for graciously allowing the team to use the shaketable and to Dr. Reza Hessabi for teaching our team on how to operate the shaketable.

                    <p>
                        The results from these shaketable tests were essential for calibrating our analysis model as well as for deriving the fundamental modal properties of our design.
                        Once our analysis model had been properly calibrated, we were able to optimize the design of the structure through seeking the most cost-effective cross-sectional width of our tubular design that can still allow for architectural flexibility.

                    <p>This parametric study was conducted using a script written in Excel VBA alongside the SAP2000 oAPI plugin.
                        The results of our analysis and collaboration with architectural students accumulated to the design of the Aqua tower.
