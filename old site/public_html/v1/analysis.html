				<h2>Frequency Analysis</h2>
				<p>
				This analysis takes into account the stiffness of the structure and the distribution of mass to determine the natural frequency of the structure.
				Defining the number of degrees of freedom of a structure is pertinent in earthquake analysis.
				Frequency analysis simply takes the matrices representing the stiffness and mass of the structure and
				solves the corresponding eigen problem for both the eigenvalues (natural frequencies) and corresponding eigenvectors (mode shapes). 	
				</p>
				
				<h2>Classical Modal Analysis</h2>
				<p>
				Modal Analysis takes the governing coupled-differential equations (or equations of motions) and transforms them into modal coordinates where they become uncoupled and
				represent the time dependent deformation response of a mode. Using the natural frequencies of each mode and their corresponding mode shapes, earthquake analysis can now be undertaken. 
				</p>
				
				<h2>Earthquake Analysis</h2>
				<p>
				Both Time History Analysis and Response Spectrum Analysis are concerned with determining the deformations of the structure due to the ground motion which are used to calculated
				member forces and define failure and rely on Classical Modal Analysis to uncouple the differential equations governing the motion of the structure.
				Time History Analysis will first be outlined. 
				</p>
				
				<h2>Time History Analysis</h2>
				<p>
				This method involves solving the N-uncoupled-single degree of freedom-differential equations of motion of the structure each representing the time-dependent-deformation response
				of a single mode. Using the mode vectors along with the solved amplitude response from each modeâ€™s differential equation, the deformation of the structure,
				throughout every time step of the ground motion data, can be calculated. 	
				</p>
				
				<h2>Response Spectrum Analysis </h2>
				<p>
				Clearly, Time History Analysis can be computationally intensive as the structures get larger with more connections and members.
				So, a design-friendly approach takes advantage of the response spectrum when it is available (in our case, the Seismic Design Competition provides them each year,
				although they can also be generated quite simply). The design spectrum contains the displacement spectrum, pseudo-velocity spectrum and pseudo-acceleration spectrum.
				These are all inter-related quantities but the most important for this approach is the pseudo-acceleration spectrum.
				Put simply, it is a plot of the peak acceleration a structure will experience under a given ground motion for a set damping ratio as a function of the natural period.
				So, once the natural frequency and corresponding mode shape is known, design can be computed for the peak acceleration value found in the pseudo-acceleration plot.
				This design saves having to solve any differential equations of motion but is still dynamic in nature as it involves natural frequencies and mode shapes.
				Then, through statistically combining the contribution of each mode of the structure, response quantities, such as total deformation can be calculated. 
				</p>
